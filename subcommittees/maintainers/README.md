# The Lesson Maintainers Subcommittee

## Purpose and Scope

The Subcommittee maintains existing [Software Carpentry][lessons-swc]
and [Data Carpentry][lessons-dc] lessons.

## What We Do

* Maintain a welcoming and positive atmosphere for contribution by:
    * responding promptly to new pull requests or issues
	* following Software Carpentry's [Code of Conduct][CoC]
* Guide discussions around lesson development and content evolution.
* Manage issues for assigned lesson repositories.
* Cut releases for assigned lesson repositories (in coordination with
  the [Lesson Infrastructure Subcomittee][infra], which sets the
  general release timeline and provides technical assistance).
* Review communications from the [Lesson Infrastructure
  Subcommittee][infra] and implement guidelines as recommended.

[indexes][lessons-swc].  Maintainers may also be listed in the
lesson's `README.md`.

for a particular lesson may be recovered from that lesson's repository
by looking at the `README.md` history (for lessons which list their
maintainers there).
