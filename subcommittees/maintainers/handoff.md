Dear SWC community,

Due to other commitments, I am looking to turn over my role as one 
of the [lesson] maintainers to an interested volunteer.  

The main duties of lesson maintenance include reviewing and merging new 
pull requests, tracking issues, keeping the lesson up to date with the 
standard template, and helping guide the direction of the lesson - both 
in terms of content, and formatting.  The lesson maintainer is not required 
to submit their own changes to the lesson in response to particular issues, 
but they are welcome to submit PRs as they choose, like any other community 
member.  [co-maintainer] will continue to be the co-maintainer of [lesson].  

If you would like to be considered, please email me separately at [contact] 
with your name, GitHub username, and a brief statement of why you're interested 
in the role by [date].  The decision of a new maintainer will be made jointly 
by myself, [co-maintainer], and other members of the SWC community 
~~~
