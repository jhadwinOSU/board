# The Local/Regional Mentor Subcommittee

## Purpose and Scope

The Subcommittee will facilitate and help those Carpentry members and Member Organizations who wish to organize and maintain local mentoring groups. This group will also discuss regional community building based on shared missions or topics matching the various interests of regional Carpentry members. 

*Examples:*

**Local Mentoring Group**

The University of Oklahoma (OU) has established a local, university based group that is made up of the locally-trained Carpentry instructors that are part of the yearly cohort trained as part of the benefits of being a Member Organization. Allows for sharing information, assisting new instructors with the certification process, and integrating new instructors into the workshop rotation of instructing at self-organized workshops. 

**Regional Community**

*Members: Univ. of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State Univ., and Univ. of North Texas*
A group of three university libraries are current Member Organizations. With shared interests of professional development of library staff based around the current development of the Library Carpentry, there is an opportunity to work together. Activities and meetings can be developed around common topics and tools found in development environments at the research libraries involved.

## What We Do

We help new Carpentry foundation members and/or regional pockets of Carpentry members to share ideas and methods of working locally and establish active and engaging local/regional communities.
