#Software Carpentry Foundation Subcommittees

## Purpose and Rationale

Software Carpentry is volunteer-powered organization with more focus
areas than the Steering Committee can manage directly.  Subcommittes
are long-running groups composed of at least one Steering Committee
member (the *liaison*) and an arbitrary number of other people who are
focused on maintaining a particular aspect of the Software Carpentry
community.

We encourage the community to propose new initiatives in the form of
Subcommittees (standing groups for ongoing activities) and [Task
Forces](../TaskForces/README.md) (ad hoc groups focused on a finite
task).

## Current Subcommittees

* [Assessment](assessment/README.md)
* [Communication](communication/README.md)
* [Finance](finance/README.md)
* [Lesson Infrastructure](lesson-infrastructure/README.md)
* [Lesson Maintainers](maintainers/README.md)
* [Partner Relations and Fundraising](partner-relations/README.md)
* [Code of Conduct and Policy](policy-CoC/README.md)

## Former Subcommittees

* [Lesson Organization and Develpment](lessons/README.md).
  This subcommittee has been replaced by the [Lesson Infrastructure](lesson-infrastructure/README.md) and [Lesson Maintainers](maintainers/README.md) subcommittees.
* [Trainers](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers). All documentation related to the former Trainers subcommittee (made up of all instructor trainers) has been migrated to the [carpentries/trainers](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers) GitHub repo.  

## How to Propose a New Subcommittee

Do you have an idea for an activity or service that would make
Software Carpentry even more awesome to participate in for its
instructors or students?  To propose a new Subcommittee, please read
