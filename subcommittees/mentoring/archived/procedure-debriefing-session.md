# Procedure - Debriefing Session

This document describes how debriefing sessions
are organized so that it is sustainable.

## Terminology

-   **SCF**: Software Carpentry Foundation.

-   **DC**: Data Carpentry.

-   **Debriefing session**: is an online meeting
    where instructors share experience about the workshops
    they recently taught.

-   **Facilitator**: is a member of the Mentoring Subcommittee
    that attends the debriefing session to coordinate it
    and write a blog post about it.

## Motivation

1.  SCF and DC are community based projects
    and the community need opportunity to interact.

2.  SCF and DC believe in jugyokenkyu, or "lesson study",
    and evidence-based education
    so instructors need opportunity to exchange experience.

## Let's do a Debriefing Session

The Mentoring Subcommittee is responsible for organizing
the debriefing sessions so that

-   each month has at least one debriefing session,

-   instructors are notified at least one week in advance and

-   the session has a facilitator to conduct the discussion.

## Inviting Instructors

The dates of the debriefing sessions are listed
in the SCF community calendar,

Invitation should be sent directly to instructors
that have taught between the last and the next debriefing session by email.
The contact address of the instructors are available at

## Show time

Each debriefing session **must** have at least one **facilitator**.

The **facilitator** is responsible for providing one place
