### ARCHIVED - This was the procedure for lesson-specific discussions run between 
### January 2016 - April 2016.  These discussions were ended in favor of more general
### discussion sessions described in [this procedure](procedure-discussion-session.md).  

# Guidelines for Checkout Discussion Sessions (Lesson Specific)

This document outlines some things that can be discussed during the 
checkout discussion sessions, where trainees come to discuss the lesson 
that they're preparing for their final teaching demonstration.  
The sessions are meant to be student-driven,
but some groups may be quieter than others.
This is by no means an exhaustive list:
other subjects are bound to come up,
and additions from discussion leaders are very welcome.

This is an informal discussion for trainees to get more comfortable with the 
training material, clarify anything that may be unclear, learn (if you are still 
unsure) how to provide feedback and contribute to the materials, especially 
in preparation for their final checkout.
The discussion lead's role is to give context to the lesson material,
as each lesson goes through many revisions and discussions
that cannot be easily seen in the finished product.

**Note:** trainees do **not** do their 5-minute demonstration lessons during the discussion sessions.
Instead,
once they have completed the discussion to the leader's satisfaction,
their names should be forwarded to their trainer
so that the demonstration lesson can be scheduled.

## Beforehand:

*   All meetings should use the Etherpad that is being used to register for discussion sessions,
    so that all comments and feedback are collected in one document.
    The Etherpad for January-February 2016 is
    [http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lesson-discussion-2016](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lesson-discussion-2016).
*   The discussion lead is free to use the Software Carpentry persistent BlueJeans connection,
    or other options such as Google Hangouts or Skype if they prefer.
    The lead must post information about the connection to the discussion session's Etherpad
    so that people will know how to join.


## During:

*   Remind students that the Etherpad is a public, persistent document,
    and that ideas and issues from the Etherpad may be used by the SCF.
*   Explain how the checkout procedure itself goes:
    *   After the trainee has completed the discussion session to the discussion leader's satisfaction,
        the leader will forward her name to the trainer.
    *   The trainer will then schedule a 5-minute slot for a demonstration lesson
        and communicate it to the trainee.
    *   In that session,
        the trainee will be asked to teach 5 minutes from her chosen lesson
        selected by the trainer.
        The trainee will *not* know in advance which 5 minutes she will be asked to teach
        (which encourages her to prepare the entire lesson).
    *   Trainees will be notified by email after their demo lesson whether they have passed.
*   Make sure that all know where the lesson material can be found.
    Ensure that they all know about the instructor guide. 
*   Discuss the fact that the lesson material is under continous development.
    Tell the students that any and all changes to the lesson material that might improve on it is welcome.
    If anybody has any comments on the material, they are very welcome. 
*   Ask for general questions.  
* 	If the group doesn't have many questions, use the following to structure discussion: 
		* When working through the lesson did you feel like you would like 
		to change the flow / present the concepts differently? If so, which ones and why?
		* Was there anything that you found unclear in the material? Did you 
		get stuck anywhere?
		* What are some misconceptions that the students could develop when 
		learning this material? Which bits of the module may be tricky and if 
		poorly explained, they may lead the students to broken mental model?
		* What prior knowledge do learners need to have before participating in 
		this module (whole lesson)? If you were to list any prerequsites, what would they be?
*   If there is time, go through each of the modules in the lesson
    and ask if anybody has any problems, questions, or comments about the module.
    This walkthrough is particularly important if any of the participants are on the quieter side.
*   It is important that we ensure that all of the participants get to discuss their issues.
    In cases where all participants are vocal, a structured walkthrough may not be necessary.

## After:

*   If any of the participants seemed unprepared (.e.g, had no questions),
    send them an email after the session asking them to sign up for another discussion session. 
*   Report to the trainers the people who were in your session,
    and whether you deemed them ready to go forth to the checkout session.

## Rational for questions

* Question 1 and Question 2 should help instructor trainees become 
more comfortable with the collaborative lesson development approach used 
by Software and Data Carpentry. Whilst it is natural that teaching from 
the material created by others may be a challenge at the beginning, it is 
worth remembering that these materials have been developed collaboratively, by 
people with different perspectives. Hopefully, this allows development of materials 
that are well balanced. The discussion session is an opportunity to clarify 
anything that trainees found confusing in the material, discuss the logical flow of 
the lessons and possible ways of delivering them. It is also beneficial to all 
stakeholders involved in Software and Data Carpentry if "all of our 
instructors are (...) using our lessons rather than legacy material of their own."
* Question 3 at the the discussion session makes a reference back to our 
Instructor Training and helps trainees develop more awareness about possible broken 
mental models which students may have or may develop learning the particular module.
* Question 4 refers back to the Instructor Training and helps trainees consider 
what is OK to assume about the prior knowledge for this module and what 
assumptions about learners knowledge should probably not be made.
