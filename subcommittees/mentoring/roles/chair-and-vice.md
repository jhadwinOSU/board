### Meeting Times

Historically we had two meetings a month, and each meeting was held twice in a 
day to accomodate time zones.  

In December 2016, the chair (Christina Koch) decided to move to meeting one day 
a month, with two time slots.   

There is currently no set meeting time.  

### Creating a Calendar Event

When creating a new event or updating a old one.

![Calendar event steps](img/calendar-event.png)

1. Set the name of the event or meeting.

2. Set the date. **Please use UTC time.**
   If using Google Calendar select Accra, Ghana or Reykjavik, Iceland
   since they don't have daylight saving time.

3. Set the location.
   If using Google Hangout select "Add video call".
   Otherwise add the link to the video conference room.

4. Set the description.
   **The link to the agenda goes here.**

5. Set notifications.
   Is good to have one notification on the day before and another 10 minutes before the meeting
   as email.

6. Set guests.
   For mentoring subcommittee meetings those are all the members of the subcommittee.
   For discussion sessions those are all the instructors that you invited.
