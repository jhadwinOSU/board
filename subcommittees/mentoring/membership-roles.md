# Mentoring Subcommittee Roles and Membership

## Roles

There are multiple ways to be involved with the mentoring committee and its activities.  

### Participation in Mentoring Activities

Any SWC/DC community member can participate in mentoring committee activities in 
the following ways: 

* [Discussion Session Participant](./)
	- Join a discussion about teaching workshops.  
* [Discussion Session Host/Co-Host](roles/discussion-hosts.md)
	- Lead a discussion among fellow instructors about recent or upcoming workshops. 
* [Mentor](roles/mentors.md)
	- Work with a small group of new instructors to provide support and guidance.
* [Mentee](roles/mentees.md)
	- Work with a mentor and fellow new instructors to prepare for teaching the 
	Software and Data Carpentry lessons, organizing workshops, and participation in the 
	Software and Data Carpentry communities.  

Participating in these events does not require that you join the mentoring 
committee as a member.  

### Mentoring Committee Membership

For those interested in becoming involved with the committee and helping organize 
and run the above (and new!) efforts, we welcome new mentoring committee members.  

Mentoring committee membership is open to anyone who is: 

* a certified instructor
* in the process of becoming certified (have attended instructor training 
or be confirmed to attend an upcoming training)
* active in the SWC/DC community as a helper, instructor, or contributor

Membership consists of: 
* joining the [mentoring committee mailing list][comm-mailing-list]
* attending at least one mentoring committee meeting every 2-4 months
* contributing to the mentoring committee's efforts in some way, including
	* taking on an official committee role (see below)
	* participating in mentoring committee activities (see above)
	* spearheading a task force or starting a new committee
	* ...or something else!  

All mentoring committee members are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/).   

See the [README](README.md) for a list of current members.  

### Mentoring Committee Positions

These roles are filled by [members](#mentoring-committee-membership) of the 
mentoring subcommittee, in order to support 
the operation and activities of the subcommittee.  

* [Chair and Vice-Chair](roles/chair-and-vice.md)
	- Coordinate mentoring efforts, organize and lead mentoring committee meetings
* [Secretary](roles/secretary.md)
	- Take notes in mentoring committee meetings, submit official minutes
* [Steering Committee Liaison](roles/liaison.md)
	- Facilitate communication between the steering committee and mentoring committee
* [Discussion Coordinators](roles/discussion-coordinators.md)
	- Coordinate volunteer hosts for instructor discussion sessions, contact instructors

Current members in these roles are listed in the [README](README.md)

## Choosing Mentoring Committee Member Roles

Mentoring committee positions are to be filled yearly, in March.  Members 
can volunteer for any role.  Roles are filled in the order listed 
above, by a majority vote.  Whenever possible roles should
be filled by unique people; however, if there are not enough volunteers, 
one person may hold up to two positions.  

In the case that a member is not able to fulfill the duties of their role for the 
full term, a member will be chosen to fill that role until the time of the next 
turnover.
