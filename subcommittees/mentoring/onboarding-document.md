#### Mission Statement   
Established in 2015 to develop and maintain a mentoring program. The program supports instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities. We help promote community-building and networking, by providing (virtual) spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and discuss teaching strategies.    
#### What does the mentoring committee do?
Meets as a committee once a month. 
#### During meetings we discuss: 
* Instructor discussions:
  * How are the instructor discussions going?
  * Formulate and update agenda items for the instructor discussions.
  * Discuss how to improve the instructor discussions.
  * Brainstorm ways to make the instructor check out process more useful and efficient.
  * Build a discussion host community, so hosting duties do not fall onto a handful of people every time.
* How can we better mentor and connect new/experienced instructors?
* How to encourage members of the community to become more involved?
* How can we support instructors in parts of the world where there is not currently a local supportive community? How can our community build/grow in places in which the Carpentries may or may not currently exist?
* How can our community be more inclusive?

### Instructor Discussion Sessions

The mentoring committee’s main duty is to lead and organize the instructor discussion sessions. The instructor discussion etherpad: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion 
* Each month has at least eight discussion sessions
* Instructors are notified at least one week in advance of their workshop and can sign up for their preferred time 
* Each session has at least one host and one co-host/notetaker to conduct the discussion:

**Host:** The host is the leader of the discussion session and will be the main discussion guide. The host is expected to share their experiences being an instructor and to keep the discussion on track.
  * Please take notes in the etherpad when the co-host/notetaker is speaking. 
  * Email co-host/notetaker to see if they would like any advice/guidance - especially if it is their first time co-hosting/notetaking or you don’t know your co-host/notetaker
**Co-host/note taker:** The co-hosts main role is to take notes on the discussion session and to share their experience as an instructor when they can. It is especially important for the co-host to step in with their experience when there are many instructor training check-outs in the session. Otherwise, the co-host can mainly take notes. 
  * Please sign up to host or co-host a discussion session! :)
  * If you notice that no one is signed up to be host, it can be helpful if you email the listserv asking for people to sign up to host/co-host.
  * Meeting scheduling will be coordinated via etherpad.
* The dates of instructor discussion sessions are also listed in the SCF community calendar,  https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com.

#### Signing Up to Host/Co-Host Discussion

* Identify a discussion session you’d like to host OR co-host on the Instructor Discussion etherpad: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion 
* Type your name in the “Host” or “Co-host/notetaker” slot for the session you’ve chosen (email next to your name optional, however, if you provide your e-mail it may help facilitate communication before and after the discussion)
* Add the time/date details of the discussion session you’re going to be a “Host” or "Co-host/notetaker" for on your calendar
* Copying the etherpad link in your calendar event is a good idea, too!

#### Host Expectations
**Expectations for hosts**
* Primary role is to facilitate the instructor discussion sessions using the agenda at the bottom of the etherpad.
* While it’s the co-hosts main responsibility to take notes, please take notes in the etherpad when the co-host/notetaker is speaking. 
* Maintaining focus on the main goal of the session, which is to share ideas, support each other, and keep instructors excited about teaching.
* Ensuring instructors teaching in the near future have urgent questions or concerns addressed.
* Collecting feedback from instructors who have recently taught.
* Engaging newly trained instructors and evaluating their participation using a subset of questions described in the checkout procedure here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/.
* Encouraging attendees to create issues or pull requests to correct problems.
**Checklist for hosts in sessions**
* Before the discussion
    * One or two days before discussion: 
      * Check the Instructor Discussion etherpad to see if someone has signed up as your co-host
      * If you are not familiar with your co-host, email them to introduce yourself and see if they have any questions about the expectations for the call
      * If you are familiar with your co-host already, it is encouraged to send them a quick email acknowledging that you’ll be on the call together
    * 5 minutes before the discussion session starts:
      * Visit the Instructor Discussion etherpad a few minutes before the meeting starts
      * Check that the agenda has been copied into the etherpad
* Joining the call:  Sign into the video conference call (around line 6 on the etherpad) by using either the: 
    * Zoom app - must download the app on your device and enter meeting ID number located at top of etherpad to join the meeting
    * Zoom browser - click the meeting link at the top of the etherpad and the meeting will open in a new window in your browser
    * Join by phone if you’re unable to connect through Zoom video - you can still take notes in the etherpad and contribute to the conversation - you just won’t be able to see people and they won’t be able to see you
**Hosting the discussion session**
* Lead the discussion:
* Introduce everyone at the beginning of the session (we usually introduce each other by the order in the etherpad)
* Be sure to introduce your co-host
* It is recommended to follow the main points of the agenda in the etherpad, but feel free to let discussion go where people want. Not all the questions need to be answered by everyone.
* Don't feel like you have to answer all the questions as the host - draw on the other discussion participants to answer each other's questions.
* If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt them to ask a question.
* Try to leave enough time at the end for the final agenda item.
* Help your co-host take notes when you can
**After the meeting discussion session**
  * **Note:** a link for the post-discussion host checklist is also located on line 15 of the instructor discussion session etherpad.
  * Email checkout@carpentries.org with the names and affiliations of instructor trainees who attended and participated in discussion. In the email you should state whether the instructor checkouts in your discussion session were engaged and could answer target questions described in the checkout procedure.
  * Copy your notes to this google doc and label with the date and which session you led.
  * These discussion notes will be used for a more formalized assessment of the lessons, mentoring, discussion sessions, and community development.
  * Archive the etherpad  by clicking the star in the top left corner. This will save a copy of the etherpad in its current state. Then, delete all the comments and change the dates to prepare the etherpad for the next session.
  * Clean the Etherpad for the next user.
  * (Optional) Write a blog post summarizing topics discussed, including (but not limited to) the following: implementation of new lessons, recurring questions about or problems while teaching, and general strategies for instructing workshops. This template can be used as the start point for the blog post.

#### Co-Host Expectations
**Expectations for co-hosts/notetakers**
* Primary role is to assist with note-taking while the Host leads the discussion
* Take accurate notes of discussion on the etherpad
* At the beginning of the callI, introduce yourself as the co-host/notetaker 
* Co-hosts/notetakers do not have to be the very active in the conversation
* If a co-host/notetaker does want to chime in, it is welcome!
* **NOTE:** if the session is mostly instructor checkouts, it is highly recommended that you, as the co-host, contribute to the discussion with your experience helping out with workshops.

**Checklist for co-hosts/notetakers in sessions:**
* **Day of discussion session:**
  * 5 minutes before the discussion session starts:
  * Visit the Instructor Discussion etherpad a few minutes before the meeting starts
  * Under the discussion session details, copy and paste the agenda guide from the bottom of the etherpad to take notes using this outline format
  * **OR** - if you’d like to take notes without the outline format, that is fine, too - whatever you’re most comfortable with
* Joining the call:  Sign into the video conference call (around line 6 on the etherpad) by using either the: 
  * Zoom app - must download the app on your device and enter meeting ID number located at top of etherpad to join the meeting
  * Zoom browser - click the meeting link at the top of the etherpad and the meeting will open in a new window in your browser
  * Join by phone if you’re unable to connect through Zoom video - you can still take notes in the etherpad and contribute to the conversation - you just won’t be able to see people and they won’t be able to see you
* While taking notes during the discussion:
  * It is usually easiest to take notes directly under the current discussion session details on etherpad - makes it easier for discussion participants to find toward top of etherpad
  * Try to make note of who is saying what - see examples below
    * Aaron (initials can work, too): Seeking advice about trying to ensure learners are downloading software before workshop
    * Bill: Recommends emphasizing software downloads with pre-workshop reminder emails you send out
    * Corey: If possible, encourage learners to arriving about 30 minutes early if they’re having issues downloading software - this means instructors and the workshop room need to be available then
  * Don’t worry about accuracy, the goal is noting the main discussion content 
  * You can always go back and edit/clean up after the discussion!
  * If you want to contribute to the conversation but worry about typing and talking at the same time, feel free to ask the host to take over on notes while you’re talking
  * Or you can go in and fill in what you said after you’re done talking
  * When you’ve cleaned up your notes, you can let the discussion host know they are ready for archival
* **After the discussion session**
  * See if there are other times you may gain more experience as a co-host/notetaker for future sessions. 
  * After you have helped out at instructor discussions a few times, please feel welcome to sign up as a host!  
  * You can even try to see if an experienced host (i.e. the host you served as co-host for) would serve as your co-host/notetaker for your first time hosting a discussion session to help ease you into the role of host
