# Mission

The Mentoring Subcommittee was established in 2015 to develop and maintain a mentorship program to support instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities. We help promote community-building and networking by providing (virtual) spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and discuss strategies for overcoming challenges.

## Past Activities

* Instructor-Helper Retreat: In November 2015, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors and helpers got together together at sites around the world for a day of sharing skills, trying out new lessons and ideas and discussing all things instructor and helper related. To see the schedule for the 2015 retreat, visit: http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-retreat-2015/

*  Archived: Pre- and Post- Workshop Debriefing Session: Before launching the Instructor Discussion Sessions, we used to host separate [pre- and post-workshop debriefing sessions](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/categories/#debriefing). We are grateful to all the hosts and participants who attended these sessions.
