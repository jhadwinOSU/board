# Revised Lesson Template

The maintainers [voted](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template/issues/304) in June 2016
to adopt a [new lesson template](https://github.com/gvwilson/new-lesson-example/) that:

*   uses Jekyll rather than Pandoc for translation
    (so that HTML files don't have to be generated client-side and committed)
*   uses Jekyll collections to manage episodes
    (so that previous and next links can be generated)
*   uses Twitter Bootstrap for typography and layout
    (because it looks nice)
*   supports both Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry with a single configuration setting
    (so that all our lessons have uniform look and feel)
