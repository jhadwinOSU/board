<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles/issues/131>use .editorconfig</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Using [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) will help with having more consistently edited files (tabs vs spaces etc.). The advantage is that it can store configuration for all used languages and file types so that we can have single `.editorconfig` file for all lessons. `.editorconfig` is recognised automatically by most popular text editors.

<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles/pull/129>ensure dt elements have an id set</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Anchor links in the glossary do not currently work in any of the lessons. As @gvwilson mentions in https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/issues/305, if Github updates their version of kramdown in pages-gem this issue would be resolved. However, it is unclear when this merge will occur - https://github.com/github/pages-gem/pull/398

This is a workaround for now, and can potentially be removed when the kramdown version is updated in pages-gem

This issue was also mentioned in https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/pull/315

<h2>
<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles/issues/125>Gallery of images/quizzes</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
It is sometimes desirable to show workshop participants a single image or quiz. A good example is the image in the introduction to Git. While it is totally possible to show the webpage with the image,  it would be great to have a page with all images where instructors could simply click to show an image. Alternatively, there could be a page where instructors could click-through the images. Something like below.
```
                       ---------------
                       |             |
(Prev) <=              |    image    |           => (Next)
                       |             |

<h2>
<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles/issues/124>Image width</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Images in the following examples appear too large when rendered with gh-pages. Specifying the width of the image using HTML results in the image not rendering at all.

Is there a way to specify the width manually? If not, it would be very nice to be able to specify the width of the image in Markdown, could we create an additional image CSS class to have more flexibility.

# "Limitations"

Jupyter notebook doesn't allow cells inside cells what makes having something like

~~~
> ## Challenge Title
>
> This is the body of the challenge.
>
> ```{python}
> it may include some code that Jupyter notebook is going to execute
> ```
> {: .source}
>

> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
~~~

but Jupyter doesn't sanitize the HTML in Markdown cells what allows us to have the open of a HTML tag in one Markdown cell and the close of that HTML tag in another Markdown cell, like

<blockquote class="challenge">
## Challenge Title

This is the body of the challenge.

```{python}
it may include some code that Jupyter notebook is going to execute
```

<blockquote class="solution">
## Solution

This is the body of the solution.

```{python}
it may also include some code that Jupyter notebook is going to execute
```
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

**I know that we try to avoid type HTML but I couldn't find another solution.**

<h2>
<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example/pull/93>Towards a more fully offline capable rendering of a lesson</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Basic ideas here are that:

1) Fully offline (no server required) browsing of a rendered _site directory's contents only
    fails to work at present because of the lack of an "index.html" (or equivalent) at the end
    of the bare URIs, which a webserver would usually, automatically, populate, eg Apache's
   `DirectoryIndex` Directive, and so, for example,
```
    file:///path/to/_site/02-tooling/
```
   currently presents the offline user with that directory's contents, and so then they have to
   physically select  `index.html`, whereas, the ability to browse via a URI that a webserver
   would dynamically create, ie.,
```
    file:///path/to/_site/02-tooling/index.html
```
   would present the user with actual page they expect to see.

2) the lesson template's repos already contain both a `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    and plain text `CITATION` file, but the links in the `lesson_footer.html` point
    back to the "blobs" within the remote source repo, so that content, albeit already
    there on disk in the cloned repo, is not available to the offline user browsing the
    rendered _site.

The simple changes suggested here, which I believe require changes to both the main lesson
example repo, and to the style repo, at the same time (submitted here as I am not sure
as to how to go about that !) would thus:

1) add a methodology for defining a `{{ site.index }}` variable which would normally be
    set to `index.html` but need not be. Similarly, the variable name I have chosen, `index`,
    need not be the name that SWC adopts should it want to provide this functionality.

2) make both the `Contributing` and `Cite` links in the footer point to rendered versions
   of the files already on disk in a cloned lesson 's local repo.

Here's hoping this is useful.

# Instructions

You can build the Docker container with

~~~

You can view the lesson on http://localhost:4000/.

# Questions

1. Should we invest on Docker for create the releases?

2. If we decided to create the releases with Docker, should we use the image to compile Jupyter Notebook and RMarkdown files to vanilla Markdown that will be processed by Jekyll?

<h2>
<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example/pull/41>Added lesson metadata and schema.org JSON-LD rendering</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Hi,

I thought it might be a good idea to help the discoverability of training materials by having more metadata examples in the config, and by rendering the metadata into a [schema.org CreativeWork specification](schema.org/CreativeWork) using the JSON-LD representation.

Structuring metadata using Schema.org is very useful for SEO to get included in more Google SERPs; as well as for content integration platforms like [TeSS - The Life Science Training Portal](tess.elixir-uk.org). There's more about it on the working group page for [BioSchemas](bioschemas.org)

The variables declared in the _config.yml file are the attributes of the lesson correlated to the CreativeWork type. They are declared there and then rendered in JSON-LD in the schema_org.html partial in 'includes' folder. This is partial is called in _layouts/lesson.html

I've added a few example attributes but these variables could theoretically be the whole of http://schema.org/CreativeWork

# Limitations

Start and end time of the workshop. The `humantime` that we use is difficult to parse **on [Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/)** so that we can use on the template.

Non-registered user can add the event to their calendar. This is a first world problem!

<h2>
<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/issues/360>List location in info summary box at top of the main page.</a>

<pre>
I usually end up adding the workshop location to the info box at the top of the page, so that learners don't need to scan for it in the "General Information" section.  For two examples, see [2016-10-06-harvard](https://sorgerlab.github.io/2016-10-06-harvard/), and [2016-04-29-ucsf](https://bsmith89.github.io/2016-04-29-ucsf/).

It fits (both spatially and logically) in the first column with the date and time.  It would also be useful to link to a map service, but I'm not sure if it should be Google Maps or Open Street Maps.

Sorry if I missed where this has been discussed before.  I can submit a pull request based on what I've done for workshops in the past, but I may not be the best person to choose an implementation for everyone.

<pre>
@rgaiacs has created a new repo, see #337 for a Portuguese translation of the workshop template. Longterm I'd really rather these all go in one repository with directories or branches for each language and some template logic to pick the language. There isn't really a good reason to have a new repo for each language and it creates a headache in the future if we make changes they have to be applied to multiple repos.

Any technical solutions you can think of that don't require backbreaking Jekyll gymnastics and would support multiple languages for the workshop page content?

<h2>
<a href=https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/pull/305>index.html: Add YAML front matter for toggling per-tool setup instructions</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
@iglpdc [brought this idea back up in maintainers@ recently](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/maintainers_lists.software-carpentry.org/2016-March/000179.html).  I
think the last time it was raised seriously was in swcarpentry/bc#738,
which has reasonable links into earlier discussion.  The main argument
against that approach was that it was [too hard to find the source for
a particular line you wanted to tweak](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/729#issuecomment-56470499).  This commit restores our
old liquid templating to show/hide sections _without_ splitting the
sections out into sub-files (e.g. swcarpentry/bc#738 had
`_includes/setup/linux-editor.html`).  If we keep everything in the
index file, we can have tags and instructors can either adjust the
tags or easily find/edit/delete as they see fit.

A few notes on the implementation:
- I've gone with double quotes in the YAML front matter for
  consistency with the other entries, but stuck with the original
  (from swcarpentry/bc) single quotes for the liquid conditionals.
- I've kept "test" and "VM" out of the default tools list to match
  the current display, but we may want to enable everything and write
  a stronger message about removing stuff you don't need to avoid
  repeating the [problems we had with the test-link being visible by
  default](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/pull/278).  Because folks will have to tweak the tools list if
  they want to enable the "test" or "VM" sections, I've added
  comments at the beginning of each section pointing instructors back
  up at the YAML front matter.
- I've moved the "test" section out of the Python section, because
  while the tool doesn't currently test R packages, it does test Git,
  Bash, text editors, etc., and it could certainly be [extended to
  test R if someone with R knowledge wanted to chip in (although it's
  harder to _run_ the script on Windows without bundling Python)](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/issues/136#issuecomment-111157301).
