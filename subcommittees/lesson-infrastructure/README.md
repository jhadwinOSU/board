# The Lesson Infrastructure Subcommittee

## Purpose and Scope

The Subcommittee maintains infrastructure shared by all lessons and
workshop repositories.

## What We Do

* Manage [lesson release process][release] and coordinate lesson
  releases (in coordination with the [Lesson Maintainers
  Subcommittee][maintainers] which cuts the lesson repository
  releases).
* Group decision-making for any changes that will affect more than one
  lesson.  This applies to lessons officially described as “supported”
  by the Carpentries.
* Maintenance of the following general repositories:

    * [styles][]
    * [lesson-example][]
    * [workshop-template][]

* Determine workflows for general issues related to lesson
  maintenance.
* Communicate with [maintainers][] about changes to general
  repositories and common workflows.

## Motions

Past motions are archived [here](motions).

## Related Projects

* The content of specific lessons is managed by the
  [Lesson Maintainer Subcommittee][maintainers].
