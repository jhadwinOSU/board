Welcome to the Software Carpentry email list
============================================

This is a shared list for Software and Data Carpentry community members.

Software and Data Carpentry are community organizations. We value the involvement of every one in this community - learners, instructors, hosts, developers, steering committee members and staff. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in Software Carpentry events or communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Software and Data Carpentry activities is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Software Carpentry, including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, online forums and on GitHub.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can and can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing admin@software-carpentry.org or any of the Steering Committee members. All communication will be treated as confidential.

**Code of Conduct**

Software and Data Carpentry are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.

- Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

- Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. People violating these rules may be asked to leave the event or be excluded from the online venue at the sole discretion of the organizers, without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
