# Software Carpentry Foundation Task Forces

## Purpose and Rationale

Software Carpentry is volunteer-powered organization with more focus
areas than the Steering Committee can manage directly.  Task Forces
are are focused on a single, one-time goal like hosting an event,
producing a document, or studying a question relevant to the Software
Carpentry community.  Task Forces are composed of at least one
Steering Committee member (the *liaison*) and an arbitrary number of
other people who are focused on that goal.

We encourage the community to propose new initiatives in the form of
[Subcommittees](../subcommittees/README.md) (standing groups for
ongoing activities) and Task Forces (ad hoc groups focused on a finite
task).

## Current Task Forces
* [2018 CarpentryCon](2018-CarpentryCon/README.md)

## Former Task Forces
* [2017 CarpentryCon](2017-CarpentryCon/README.md)
* [Fees](fees/README.md)

## How to Propose a New Task Force

Do you have an idea for an activity that would make Software Carpentry
even more awesome to participate in for its instructors or students?
Is there a project, tool or document that would benefit you and your
community?  To propose a new Task Force, please read the
[information here](../subcommittees/proposal_instructions.md).
