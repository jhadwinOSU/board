# The SWC Lesson Organization Task Force

## Purpose and Scope

The Software Carpentry (SWC) Lesson Organization Task Force will 
meet to discuss current Software Carpentry lesson maintenance issues

## What We Do

A preliminary list of issues to be discussed is on [this etherpad][swc-lessons-etherpad].
We will be starting regular meetings at the end of September.  

## Measuring Progress

Our timeline and goals are as follows:

	* Updates emailed to maintainer's list
	* [Minutes](minutes) posted to the `swcarpentry/board` repository
