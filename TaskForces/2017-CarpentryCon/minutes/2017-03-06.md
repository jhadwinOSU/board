## Announcements
An organizer for a recent Stan Con meeting shared his notes about the time committment for planning. It could be a useful resource Stan Con http://mc-stan.org/events/stsouancon

I'll start off with some information that would have saved us some time:
- get sponsor commitments early. We got two financial sponsors in the last couple weeks. A lot of my time was spent trying to stretch the few dollars we had.
- try to estimate the right ballpark number of people. I started pricing our services assuming we'd top out at 50 people. We got to 160.

I'm going to try to ballpark time commitment and total elapsed time. And I'm breaking it apart in just chunks that I was thinking about it.
- Post-conference: 2 days. Elapsed: 4 weeks. Clean-up, thank you notes, paying vendors.
- Conference: 1 day. Elapsed (for me): 1 day. We had 4 people at check-in for 2 hours, and then 2 people on duty at all times. We had a separate person for time keeping and one person for speaker wrangling.
- Swag:  2 days. Elapsed: 3 weeks. We packed our own, so that took 4 hours x 2 people + there was time in balancing #s and working through Eventbrite. It took us about a day to make orders and decide on vendors, decide on quantities, type of swag, design.
- Schedule / speakers: 1 day. Elapsed: 1 month. I spent about a day getting our coordinator working, but he spent a lot more time organizing.
- Conference programs / badges: - 2 days. Elapsed: 1 week. We printed these on our own and it took a lot longer than I had anticipated. We would have had less trouble if we knew we had sponsor money.
- Catering: 2 days. Elapsed: 1 month. I had to change the order 4 times between the start and end.
- Eventbrite:  1 day. I spent a lot more time on it than necessary. The tools are pretty crude.
- Organization: 5 days. I spent a couple hours every week thinking through the next steps and keeping everyone in synch. I remember one Saturday a couple weeks before the conference spending a solid 8 hours just organizing. I was shocked at how long it took me to do so.
- Fundraising: Way too long. Lots of emails. Lots of taking meetings and emails and calls that didn't pan out.
I think that was a bulk of my time. If you have any specific questions on where I spent my time, please reach out. I think I may be off by 1/2x to 2x for all those estimates. I could nail it down a little better.
